Today's session : Rest Architecture Principles
----------------------------------------------

-> For SOAP Webservices we have specification (WS-I Provided)  

-> For RESTful Services we don't have any specification

-> Roy Fielding provided some architecture principles to develop Restful services.

Rest Architecture Principles
----------------------------
1) Unique Addressibility

2) Uniform Constraint Interfaces

3) Message Oriented Representation

4) Communication Stateless

5) HATEOS (Hypermedia as an engine for application state)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Unique Addressibility represents every resouce should bind to unique address (Unique URL pattern)

-> All the resource methods should be unique and limited (We should bind rest resource methods to Http Protocol Methods)
	
	- GET method ---------> @GetMapping
	- POST method --------> @PostMapping
	- PUT method  --------> @PutMapping
	- DELETE method ------> @DeleteMapping

-> According client request, resource will process the data. Clients can choose input and output data formats according to their requirement.

-> Rest Resource will not store any information related to client. Every request will be treated as first request only (session concept will not be available).

-> Resource will represent response to clients in Hypermedia format (hyperlinks)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Sun Microsystem supported for above Rest Architecture principles and released one api to develop Restful Services.

		JAX-RS API

-> JAX-RS API stands for 'Java Api For XML - Restful Services'.

-> For JAX-RS API we have below 2 implementations

		a) Jersey  (sun)
		b) REST Easy (JBoss)


***************Spring Framework Also Supports REST Development************

-> By using Spring MVC Module we can develop RESTFul Services (This is an alternate for jax-rs)


Q) Can we develop RESTful Service using Spring Boot?
---------------------------------------------------
Ans) Yes, we can develop using spring-boot-starter-web dependency
