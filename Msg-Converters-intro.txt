Today's class : Msg Converters Intro
------------------------------------------------------------
-> Message converters are used to convert messages in Restful services

-> Rest api methods will be designed with objects of data for loosely coupling

-> Client can't subject and can't recive objects.

-> To achive intereoperability client will send xml/json data as input and client will expect xml/json data as output.

-> Resource side message converters will convert xml/json data to java object and java object to xml/json data

-> With XML & JSON formats we can achieve intereoperability

-> To convert   Xml <------> java objects we will use JAX-B API

-> To convert  Json <------> Java objects we will use JACKSON API.
